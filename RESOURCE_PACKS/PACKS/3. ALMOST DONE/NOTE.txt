EXCEPT FOR DEFAULT...

Need to create splash files, if needed...

May need to convert fonts / get loading bar colors (in css?/RandomLevelWorker.js?)

If there is altered music, then convert the music files too.

Textures that still need editing (texture files and code in app.js):
* water
* lava

After all textures are done, create the last file (BACKGROUND.JPG)
